# Telegram_bot_constructor
Free telegram bot constructor based on Google services

No code solution (well, almost). You don't have to program. The required time to launch the bot is 8 minutes, but this is not accurate. 

When you personally or a small company need to launch a bot in Telegram, a problem arises. Most of the designers are paid or conditionally free — a time-limited free trial period, or limited functionality. There are also free solutions, but you need to be able to program or pay for the developer's work. As a result, creating a bot costs money.

I wrote a Telegram bot constructor based on Google Sheets. Google tables are free. And the bot also turned out to be free, both in setup-launch and maintenance. 
Pease copy this table and customize: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h3PjYSnTtf6hCA6umwh3KZQ76zSCtVA44unaIPL0-hk/edit#gid=1596994453
There is an instruction in the table.

Now the simplest functionality is implemented — a sequence of questions to the user and an answer. The questions just need to be entered in the cells of the table. The answer is the same. You can also send a personal message to the user-the result. It changes depending on the user's responses.
